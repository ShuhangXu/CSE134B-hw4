# Part 5: Site Changes and 3rd Party Script
[My Website](https://jazzy-pithivier-abad16.netlify.app/)
## Site Changes:
- Adjust the display setting so that side-navigator will show up only when it is in the correct size
- Add hw4 navigation
- Add a new page(post) with CRUD. When the real posts are completed, add the link right below the summary and call it read more. When clicked, move to the post page.
- Post will show as a new navigator
- Adjust the layout of all pictures, videos, input, textbox, font so that they could shrink according to user's window resize
- Change the post page layout a light bit. Fix the height of post block, ensuring that everything will show in the same page and add new post button is always visable to user.

## 3rd Party Script:
- Enable the Google Analytics: To check how visitors per week. It's important because I can have an opportunity to find who visits my website and who is potentially interested in building connection with me. Through monitoring the data, I can have an idea that if I am going to optimize my website to make it more attractive.
- Enable Google Map API to see show my current location: To display user where I am, so that if they are close to me and interested in building connections with me, they can submit the contact form and we are arrange an in-person meeting. That's really helpful to students who are looking for internships.
